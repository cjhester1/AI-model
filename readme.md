# AI Model Showcase

Welcome to my AI model showcase! This website features various AI models powered by ChatGPT, implemented using Vite, React.js, Redux for state management, and styled with Tailwind CSS.

## Technologies Used

- **Vite:** A build tool that focuses on providing a fast development experience.
- **React.js:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux:** A predictable state container for JavaScript apps, helping manage the application's state efficiently.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for creating custom designs quickly.
- **ChatGPT:** A state-of-the-art language model developed by OpenAI, powering the AI interactions on the site.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cjhester1/ai-model.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash

## <a name="features">üîã Features</a>

üëâ **Modern User Interface**: A modern and user-friendly interface, offering an intuitive experience for users.

üëâ **Summary Generation**: Users can input the URL of a lengthy article, and the web app utilizes AI to provide a concise summary of the article content.

üëâ **History Saving with Local Storage**: The app includes a history feature, allowing users to save summaries locally, providing a convenient way to revisit and manage their reading history.

üëâ **Copy to Clipboard Functionality**: Enables users to easily share or store the summarized content by copying it to their clipboard.

üëâ **Advanced RTK Query API Requests**: Utilizes the advanced capabilities of Redux Toolkit (RTK) Query for making API requests. These requests fire conditionally based on specific criteria, optimizing data fetching and management.

üëâ **AI Model Demos:** Explore the capabilities of ChatGPT through interactive demonstrations showcasing different use cases and applications.
üëâ **Vite Framework:** Utilized Vite for fast development and hot module reloading during development.
üëâ **React.js:** Built the user interface components using React.js for a seamless and interactive experience.
üëâ **Redux:** Employed Redux for efficient state management, ensuring data consistency across the application.
